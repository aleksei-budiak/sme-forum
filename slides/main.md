# Open-source Governance
 	Democratic principles though open-source philosophies

Government Open Source Models (GOSMs) have the potential to play an important role by engaging the community and other stakeholders in policy analytics. A new generation of information sharing, GOSMs are the future of effective open governments – and embody the principles and philosophy of Open Source Software (OSS) by allowing public use, modification and re-distribution of the model’s source code.

### Imagine the country
## Where policies are written as the software

GOSMs level the playing field for everyone: politicians, the media, lobby groups, stakeholders, and the general public. By opening the doors of policy evaluation to the community, governments can tap into new and undiscovered capabilities for creativity, innovation, and efficiency within the public sphere. But what are the practical implications for the strategic interactions between stakeholders and governments in public policy design?

## ⇥
	(This is the symbol for Tab)

You can put a lot of text on the slide, but, really, don't do it. Let it go.

---
	*Seriously.* Stop bothering people with walls of text. And if you have to show a lot of text, do not read it all from the slide. It’s a bad habit and a very common one. No one will listen to you if you do this. People will read your slide instead. No one will remember what you said.

	They’ll be too distracted by the text to listen—and too distracted by your voice to remember what they have read. But no rule is without exception! If you have a good reason to show a wall of text, add a tab in front of your paragraph. 

Use text as your script and choose visible elements carefully. Remember: less is more.

### Bullet lists
	- Increase cognitive load
	- Look and feel robotic  
	- Are distracting
	- Bore the hell out of everyone
	- Make you predictable
	- Sound and look like notes
	- Should be notes

These should be reading notes. This kind of slide looks like a lot of work, and it directly sabotages your presentation. It's as if you finished your sentences yourself.

### Write it, cut it, paste it
## Focus on the story 

To make people listen to you, you need a good story. Stories connect. A good story has the power to make people look at the world through your eyes. The door to make them look through your eyes will not get unlocked with stock images, graphs, and bullet lists, but with your voice. 

You need beginning-middle-end. Your presentation's visuals should help you get attention, make your point, and keep people oriented. With iA Presenter, you don’t *design* your presentation, you *write* it.

### Use the text Inspector to format.

To write a headline, you add a hash in front of it. To add an image, you drag it into the Editor. Writing bold, you use **two** asterisks. To write a list, You just add a hyphen or a number with a dot. This is called Markdown.

If you play with Markdown for a couple of minutes, you’ll only need help for more difficult matters. Adding a link, footnote, or table requires more skills. To promote familiarity with advanced Markdown, we have added a formatting inspector.

### Keep em separated
## Discern what you say and what you show 

In common presentations, the script is called “notes.” They are squeezed in at the bottom of the page. They’re an afterthought. With iA Presenter, your story is the very essence of every presentation. That doesn't mean that every presentation needs to be a TED talk. But every time you speak, you need to have something to say.

Usually, what you want to say already exists in some form. You can paste an existing text, and you are 50% done. All you need are page breaks and visuals. The story-centered text-first approach is what makes iA Presenter so much faster than graphic presentation tools.

To create a page break, you simply add three hyphens like this:

## ---
	(Type this to create a page break)

### Sound and vision
## How to add images

And how do you add an image? Drag and drop.

### Goosebumps
## Let's make it!
